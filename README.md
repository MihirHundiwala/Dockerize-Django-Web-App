### In this project, we use Jenkins pipeline to build a static django website, check project status for deployment, style check it using python library flake8 and dockerize the django web app, and finally deploy it on localhost.

#### What is Docker?
<li>Docker is a tool for building, shipping and running distributed applications.</li>

<li>It gives us the ability to run our applications in a container.</li>

<li>Container can be understood as a light-weight virtual machine which has all the necessary programs and dependencies in order to run our program. It is a controlled environment isolated from the host system. It is essentially an OS virtualization.</li>

<li>Using containers for developing, testing and deploying apps ensures that the app will run on any other similar environment, thus relieving us from the "It works on my machine, so why not on yours?" scenario.</li>

<li>So what you build locally will likely work in production as well.</li>
